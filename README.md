# Aomebo Framework

Aomebo Framework (AF) is a **open-source object-oriented (OO) PHP MVC framework**. 

The framework is built to be compatible with all types of applications (even shell applications) and is fully scaleable. 
Only loads the stuff **you need** for your project and tries to place as few limits as possible on the developer.

With optional features such as:

* Advanced and easy-to-use trigger and filter system (Like Wordpress)
* Internationalization and localization with adapters (Gettext like Wordpress)
* Multiple template adapters (Smarty 3, Twig, PHP) (optional)
* Support for Models, Controllers, Modules, Views, Libraries (Centralized MVC, Decentralized MVC or combined MVC design like Zend Framework)
* Dependency-support and automatic CSS and Javascript generation (optional)
* Built-in support for PHPUnit and Xdebug
* Works out of the box with APC
* Extensive support for URL-generation and routing (with or without mod_rewrite)
* Support for different database adapters, preparing, escaping and transactions and to run without database too (MySQLi and PDO)
* Cache-system for filesystem or database (optional)
* Feedback and debug options
* Built-in support for dynamic indexing (optional)
* Built-in support for different session setups (filesystem, native PHP or database) (optional)
* Super-fast, even with database-support execution-times in a few hundred of miliseconds.

The framework is licensed by the Open license LGPL version 3.
