Aomebo Framework
============

A open-source object-oriented PHP MVC framework. 
The framework is built to be compatible with all types of applications (even shell applications) and is fully scaleable. 
Only loads the stuff you need for your project. 

With optional features such as:
* Advanced and easy-to-use trigger and filter system (Like Wordpress)
* Internationalization & localization with adapters (Gettext like Wordpress)
* Multiple template adapters (Smarty, PHP)
* Support for Models, Controllers, Modules, Views, Libraries (Centralized MVC, Decentralized MVC or combined MVC design like Zend Framework)
* Dependency-support and automatic CSS and Javascript generation
* Built-in support for PHPUnit and Xdebug
* Extensive support for URL-generation and routing (with or without mod_rewrite)
* Support for different database adapters, preparing, escaping and transactions and to run without database too (MySQLi only implement at the moment)
* Cache-system for filesystem or database
* Feedback and debug options
* Built-in support for dynamic indexing
* Built-in support for different session setups (filesystem, native PHP or database)
* Super-fast, even with database-support execution-times in a few hundred of miliseconds.
